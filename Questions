##Q1: a)Is there significant evidence that sex is independent of the student's interest towards video games
Creat a 2X2 contigency Table to compare sex and like data. 
This allows us to see if theres a correlation between the two variables. 

##Q1: b) Is there evidence that the association between sex and student's preference for playing video games
changes with grade expected?

##Q2: Fit two logistic regression models to these data, both with sex and grade as predictor variables. 
 Model 2.1 be the one to include interaction between sex and grade, and
 Model 2.2 be the one without interaction.

##Q3: Analysis using Poisson Regression:
The following table expresses the data as counts of independent students.
count like sex grade
31 no female A+
103 no female not A+
11 no male A+
18 no male not A+
26 yes female A+
88 yes female not A+
32 yes male A+
90 yes male not A+

##Q3: a)Model the counts as Poisson variables and t two models:
 Model 3.1 with explanatory variables sex, grade and like, the three two-way terms and
the three-way interaction, and
 Model 3.2 - Model 3.1 with the three-way interaction term removed

##Q4:Describe how the results from the Poisson regression models compare to
the results in part 2 under Logistic regression modelling, in terms of:
i. (5 marks) Deviance
ii. (5 marks) Wald tests
iii. (10 marks) Interpretation
